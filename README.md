# Portfolio 
Showcase all of my projects so far

# Trouble Shooting
- Contact span didn't work 'justify-center'
- Tailwind CSS is quite Convenient but Downside is I had to write CSS on HTML looks crude
- Space while fixing mobile first version - add width:100%;
overflow-x:hidden; worked!
- After deploy image didn't show up -> I copied from github image link pasted on jsx file it worked
